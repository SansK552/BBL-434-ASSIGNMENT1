Universal Plasmid Maker
BBL-434 Assignment 1

This repository contains a Python-based tool for constructing a plasmid DNA sequence using a predefined plasmid backbone, selectable markers, and user-specified design features. The implementation demonstrates plasmid construction logic using a validated test case based on the pUC19 cloning vector.

--------------------------------------------------

Assignment Objective

The objective of this assignment is to design a universal plasmid construction tool that can operate on an unknown organism. Given a DNA sequence and a plasmid design specification, the program must identify or assume an origin of replication (ORI), incorporate required plasmid features, and output a functional plasmid DNA sequence in FASTA format.

The design specification allows the user to define multiple cloning sites, selectable markers, and replication-related features. The program must also handle cases where a specified marker is not available, without causing execution failure.

--------------------------------------------------

Approach and Implementation

The plasmid construction workflow implemented in this repository follows these steps:

1. A DNA sequence is read from a FASTA file.
2. An origin of replication (ORI) is identified or assumed using a simplified approach suitable for demonstration and testing.
3. A default replication module is added to ensure plasmid maintenance.
4. A design file is parsed to extract:
   - Restriction enzyme sites for multiple cloning sites
   - Antibiotic resistance and screening markers
   - Replication-related features
5. The plasmid sequence is constructed by combining:
   - Replication module
   - Multiple cloning site sequences
   - Insert sequence
   - Antibiotic and screening marker sequences
6. For specific test cases, restriction enzyme sites (e.g., EcoRI) are removed from the output plasmid as required.
7. The final plasmid sequence is written to an output FASTA file.

Input Data

This repository includes a validated test input based on the cloning vector pUC19. The file `pUC19.fa` contains the complete plasmid sequence used to test and verify the correctness of the implementation.

Design specifications are provided through example design files, such as `Design_pUC19.txt`. These files demonstrate how restriction enzyme sites, selectable markers, and replication-related features can be specified by the user.

A list of valid restriction enzymes, selectable markers, and replication-related elements is provided in `markers.tab`.

--------------------------------------------------

Test Case

A mandatory test case based on the pUC19 plasmid is included to validate the implementation. The corresponding design file specifies the removal of the EcoRI restriction site from the original sequence. Successful execution of this test confirms that the program correctly processes design constraints and modifies the plasmid sequence accordingly.

--------------------------------------------------

Output

The output file generated by the program contains the complete plasmid DNA sequence in FASTA format. The file includes a descriptive header followed by the constructed nucleotide sequence.

--------------------------------------------------

Notes

- The origin of replication detection is implemented in a simplified manner and is clearly documented as such.
- The program safely skips design elements that are not present in the internal marker definitions.
- Generic input and design files are not included in the repository, as the focus of this submission is on demonstrating correctness using the provided pUC19 test case.
